QuasiCrystalScreenSaver is a Mac OS X screensaver that displays interesting patterns based on quasicrystals via OpenGL.

This is some old code from 2012 that I almost lost forever when bitbucket.org removed my data.

Uploaded in 2020.  I don’t believe it will build, but I didn’t want to lose the source.

Was at https://bitbucket.org/rallen/quasicrystalscreensaver previously.
